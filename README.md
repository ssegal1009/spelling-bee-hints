# spelling-bee-hints
Simple, interactive website that lets you input the letters of today's NYT spelling bee, and allows you to access 3 different types of hints for what the pangram of today is (the word that uses all 7 letters). I created this page because I love trying to get the pangram, wordle, and connections every day, and whenever I get absolutely stuck I can get a hint without just looking up the answer online!
