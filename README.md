# spelling-bee-hints
Simple, interactive web app that lets you input the letters of today's NYT spelling bee, and offers 3 different types of hints for what the pangram (the english word that uses all 7 letters) of today is. I integrated OpenAI's API chat completion to analyze the popularity of different pangrams in the English language to offer logical hints for UX.
